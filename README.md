# Task 03: Cat and Dog Classification Using SVM

# Objective:
Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset. The task involves feature extraction from images, training an SVM model, and evaluating its performance on the dataset.

# Dataset Overview:
The Dogs vs. Cats dataset from Kaggle contains labeled images of cats and dogs. These images will be preprocessed and used to train the SVM for binary classification, enabling efficient prediction of whether an image depicts a cat or a dog.
